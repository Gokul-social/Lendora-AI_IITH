# Vercel-specific requirements for backend deployment
# MINIMAL dependencies only - heavy AI/ML packages excluded due to size limits

# Core API dependencies
fastapi>=0.109.0
pydantic>=2.5.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0

# NOTE: Full backend with AI features (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.) exceeds Vercel's
# 250MB serverless function limit. For full functionality, deploy backend to:
# - Railway (recommended): https://railway.app
# - Render: https://render.com
# - Fly.io: https://fly.io
# - Or use Docker deployment locally

# If you need full AI features on Vercel, consider:
# 1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
# 2. Deploy backend to Railway/Render with full dependencies
# 3. Connect frontend to backend via environment variables
