# Vercel-specific requirements for backend deployment
# MINIMAL dependencies only - heavy AI/ML packages excluded due to size limits
# Pinned versions to minimize size and avoid pulling in unnecessary dependencies

# Core API dependencies (minimal set)
fastapi==0.109.0
pydantic==2.5.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0

# Note: uvicorn is included by FastAPI but Vercel uses its own server
# No need to explicitly include it

# NOTE: Full backend with AI features (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.) exceeds Vercel's
# 250MB serverless function limit. For full functionality, deploy backend to:
# - Railway (recommended): https://railway.app
# - Render: https://render.com
# - Fly.io: https://fly.io
# - Or use Docker deployment locally

# If you need full AI features on Vercel, consider:
# 1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
# 2. Deploy backend to Railway/Render with full dependencies
# 3. Connect frontend to backend via environment variables
