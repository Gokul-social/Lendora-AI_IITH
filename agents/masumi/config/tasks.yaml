    Conduct a thorough research on the assets for the following Cardano addresses:

    {addresses}.

    Note:
    - Use the KupoTool to get the exact amount of Cardano Native Assets that each address has. Filter by top 10 assets.
  expected_output: >
    The EXACT amount of Cardano Native Assets that each address has in the following format:

    <cardano_address_1> holds the following assets:
    1- lovelace - <exact amount of lovelace_for_address_1>
    2- <asset_id_1> - <exact amount of asset_1_for_address_1>
    3- <asset_id_2> - <exact amount of asset_2_for_address_1>
    4- ...and so on

    <cardano_address_2> holds the following assets:
    1- lovelace - <exact amount of lovelace_for_address_2>
    2- <asset_id_1> - <exact amount of asset_1_for_address_2>
    3- <asset_id_2> - <exact amount of asset_2_for_address_2>
    4- ...and so on

    ...and so on for each address.

    Follow these rules very strictly:
    - Include the unchanged amount EXACTLY as returned by the KupoTool.
    - There must NOT be duplicate assets for the same address.

token_registry_task:
  description: >
    For each address on the list, use the TokenRegistryTool to find the token names for all of the assets.
    Example of a token name is "Snek" and example of an asset ID is "279c909f348e533da5808898f87f9a14bb2c3dfbbacccd631d927a3f.534e454b".

    Follow this Chain-of-Thought process for each address:

    1. Initial Analysis:
       a. Identify all asset IDs in the list for this address
       b. Separate lovelace from other assets (lovelace doesn't need lookup)
       c. Group non-lovelace assets into batches of 15 (TokenRegistryTool limit)
       d. Document the initial state of assets

    2. Token Name Lookup:
       a. For each batch of asset IDs:
          - Use TokenRegistryTool to look up token names
          - Record the response for each asset ID
          - Note any patterns in the responses
       b. Analyze the results:
          - Which assets have token names?
          - Which assets need to keep their asset IDs?
          - Are there any unexpected responses?

    3. Data Transformation:
       a. For each asset:
          - If token name exists: Replace asset ID with token name
          - If no token name: Keep the asset ID
          - Maintain the original amount
       b. Verify the transformation:
          - All amounts remain unchanged
          - Lovelace is still first
          - No duplicate token names

    4. Quality Checks:
       a. Verify completeness:
          - All assets from list are present
          - No extra assets added
          - No assets missing
       b. Verify consistency:
          - Amounts match original list
          - Order matches original list
          - Format is consistent

    5. Documentation:
       a. For each address, document:
          - Initial asset IDs and amounts
          - Token name lookup results
          - Transformation decisions
          - Final state
       b. Note any:
          - Patterns in token name availability
          - Edge cases encountered
          - Potential issues

    Note:
    - TokenRegistryTool has a limit of 10 asset IDs per request
    - If token name is found, use it instead of asset ID
    - If token name is not found, keep using the asset ID
    - Always maintain the original amounts and order

  expected_output: >
    An updated version of the original provided list with token names where available.

    For example:

    <cardano_address_1> holds the following assets:

    1- lovelace - <amount_of_lovelace_for_address_1>
    2- Snek - <exact amount of Snek_for_address_1>
    3- fcf3707eff37f79c02c8c976b3047daf161ead2fce4a999a5deeeb18.426f6b20436869636b - <exact amount>
    4- NMKR - <exact amount of NMKR_for_address_1>
    5- 9876543210abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef.1234567890abcdef - <exact amount>
    6- ...and so on
    <cardano_address_2> holds the following assets:

    1- lovelace - <amount_of_lovelace_for_address_2>
    2- Snek - <exact amount of Snek_for_address_2>
    3- fcf3707eff37f79c02c8c976b3047daf161ead2fce4a999a5deeeb18.426f6b20436869636b - <exact amount>
    4- NMKR - <exact amount of NMKR_for_address_2>
    5- 9876543210abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef.1234567890abcdef - <exact amount>
    6- ...and so on

    ...and so on for each address.
